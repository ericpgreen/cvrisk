When controversy about the American Medical Association's cardiovascular risk calculator [made the news](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/health/risk-calculator-for-cholesterol-appears-flawed.html) in mid-November 2013, I decided to check out the "online" calculator for myself. I was surprised to learn that the "online" calculator is simply an Excel file that is available online for [download](http://my.americanheart.org/professional/StatementsGuidelines/PreventionGuidelines/Prevention-Guidelines_UCM_457698_SubHomePage.jsp).

I've been wanting to learn how to create an [R Shiny app](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) for a while now, so I figured I would see if I could redesign the Excel calculator in R and deploy on my new beta Shiny hosted account.

Note: These files are not intended to replace the AMA CV Risk Calculator or be used in a clincal context. The only purpose is to explore alternate forms of data visualization and try out a new platform.
